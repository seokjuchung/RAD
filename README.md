# RAD

1. Input Data and preprocessing: https://github.com/uboone/OpenSamples
Use the hdf5 files, 'Inclusive, WithWire'

Use `ubopendata` conda environment for this part

The `wire_table` contains (Wire, Timetick, ADC) values. I used plane2, the collection plane
The input data is preprocessed to reduce the model size.
My naming scheme is AXB, where A and B are the division factors for Timetick and Wire respectively.
The Timetick dimension is downsampled by a factor of 10 before division

ex: 10X4
Original input size values for single event is (Wire, Timetick) = (3456, 6400) --> (3456,640) after downsampling --> (864,64) after division

hdf5 files are preprocessed into npy files through `01_data2npy_full.py`. Samples are inside `inputData`

2. Training Teacher
Use `02_train_teacher.py`
Use `ubqkeras` conda environment for step 2 to 4

3. Training Student
Use `03_train_student.py`
Requires Teacher from step 2.

Trained models are saved in `savedModel`

4. Evaluating Loss (or 'Anomaly Score')
Use `04_getLoss.py`
Evaluates loss (or Anomlay Score in our language) and saves into npy file

5. Dependencies
Use `conda_envs`
If one has to install the environments from scratch, the `.txt` folders have dependencies.

`file.py`, `microboone_utils.py` are obtained from https://github.com/uboone/OpenSamples
`QDenseBatchnorm.py` is in this branch of qkeras https://github.com/google/qkeras/pull/74

6. Models: Taken from https://github.com/Princeton-AD/cicada/blob/main/models.py

Defined in `models.py`

`teacher_reshape` and `teacher_dense`, `teacher_reshape2` values need to be changed according with the prepocessed input image size
